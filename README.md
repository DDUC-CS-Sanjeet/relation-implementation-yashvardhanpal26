# Relation Implementation

Create a class MyRelation with following properties:
1. It will store elements of sets between which it exists in two arrays, and relation itself in a matrix.
2. Functions to check reflexivity, symmetricity, anti-symmetricity and transitivity.
3. Functions to find out reflexive closure, symmetric closure, transitive closure using transitive extenstions and transitive closure using warshall's algorithm.
4. Functions to check whether the relation is equivalence relation, partial ordering relation, both or none.

User must be asked beforehand whether this relation is between two different sets or is on a single set. After that size and elements of both or single array must be entered.
Relation can be directly entered as a matrix or existance of every single element can be asked.
After entering the relation, calls to functions should directly start and display appropriate information about relation.
